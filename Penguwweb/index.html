            The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a communication protocol used for discovering the link layer address, such as the MAC address, given an IP address. The ARP protocol is a very simple protocol, and it does not implement any security measure. The ARP cache poisoning attack is a common attack against the ARP protocol. Using such an attack, attackers can fool the victim into accepting forged IP-to-MAC mappings. This can cause the victimâ€™s packets to be redirected to the computer with the forged MAC address, leading to potential man-in-the-middle attacks. The objective of this lab is for students to gain the first-hand experience on the ARP cache poisoning attack, and learn what damages can be caused by such an attack. In particular, students will use the ARP attack to launch a man-in-the-middle attack, where the attacker can intercept and modify the packets between the two victims A and B. Another objective of this lab is for students to practice packet sniffing and spoofing skills, as these are essential skills in network security, and they are the building blocks for many network attack and defense tools. Students will use Scapy to conduct lab tasks. This lab covers the following topics:
